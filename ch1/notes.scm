; from video lecture youtu.be/2Op3QLzMgSY
; computer science: a lousy name. not much science
; more importantly: confusing the tools we use for the field of knowledge
; e.g., geometry: "earth measurements"

; process: how to do something.
; procedures: the steps i that process

; formalizing the how-tos of building large systems
; the way we construct these systems in an understandable
; and manageable way is by "developing techniques for
; controlling complexity" <-- this is what cs is about!
